# Automated Invoice–Payment Reconciliation (n8n)

This project demonstrates a demo of an automated finance operations workflow built with **n8n**.  
It reconciles invoices against payments using conservative, audit-friendly rules and isolates only risky cases for human review.

The workflow reflects how automation and AI can be safely applied in **finance and accounting contexts**, preserving explainability and internal controls (four-eyes principle).
